# Music Genre Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

## ABSTRACT

This paper explores the implementation and evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for music genre classification in the Python coding environment. It compares the efficiency and accuracy of two separate CNN models for a multilabel classification task using the GTZAN dataset. The two models are constructed in the Tensorflow (Keras) and Pytorch deep learning frameworks respectively, and take mel spectograms of the GTZAN au- dio as input data for training and evaluation. The results highlight the contributions of architectural choices in the networks as well as the limitations of deep learning on small datasets.
